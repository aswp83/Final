# The ALU is a digitigal circuit used to preform arthimetic and logical operations
  [^1]: It is the main componet to the  central processing unit (CPU)
  
# The ALU is divided into two parts:
UL-
    1. The arithmetic unit (ALU)
    2. The Logic Unit (LU)
    
**The ALU has direct input and output access to the processor controller, main memory, and input/output devices.**
